/**
 * AdjustBrightnessCommand - Concrete command for brightness adjustment
 *
 * Encapsulates the operation of adjusting video brightness.
 * Adjustment can be positive (brighter) or negative (darker).
 *
 * Undo Strategy:
 * - Stores previous brightness value
 * - Undo restores previous brightness
 *
 * Example:
 *   Before: Brightness = 100
 *   Execute: Adjust +20
 *   After: Brightness = 120
 *   Undo: Restore 100
